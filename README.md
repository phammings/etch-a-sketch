## About

Hovering over a grid box will highlight the default colour black.

You can change the colour by clicking the “Color Picker” input box.

The “Rainbow” button will change the color to a random colour each time you hover on a box.

The “Gray Scale” button will change the color to a light gray color and will increase in 10% darkness each time you hover on a box that has the gray scale filled in.

The “Eraser” button will erase the color from the grid each time you hover on a filled out box.

The “Clear Grid” button will erase any colour from the grid and reset the color back to the color inside the Colour Picker input box.

The “Size” input box allows you to choose a grid size based on the number you select.

The slider allows you to choose a grid size based on the slider where the left is grid size 1, and the right is grid size 64.
